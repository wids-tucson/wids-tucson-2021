<p>This talk presents a high level overview of the application of Artificial intelligence tools for the development of more sustainable solutions in the mining and critical minerals industry. Although the incorporation of AI-based tools in the minerals sector is not new, several areas are being currently benefited from the incorporation of improved tools such as those associated to Deep Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks. We present here several examples that contribute to the development of solutions associated to improved productivity, energy efficiency, safety, and social license. Research projections and future development areas are also discussed.</p>
