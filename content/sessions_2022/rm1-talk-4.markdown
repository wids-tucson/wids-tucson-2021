<p>QMTools facilitates evaluation of spreadsheets of image quality metrics (IQMs) produced by the MRIQC program (a BIDS quality assessment tool for BOLD and structural MRI images). Evaluating the IQMs to assess which datasets should be excluded is daunting, and this project enhances the ease, speed, and consistency of that process by implementing three programs to visualize, compare, and review the IQMs (traffic, fetcher, and violin). QMtools is especially valuable for assessing BOLD images because it provides context for their evaluation not available elsewhere.</p>
