      <p>Kathryn Barger is the Biostatistics Associate Director in the Biostatistics and Data Management Scientific Core Unit at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Dr. Barger specializes in collaborative research for both clinical and pre-clinical studies in human nutrition and aging. For clinical studies, Dr. Barger provides statistical support across various experimental designs, including parallel RCTs, prospective longitudinal cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, crossover intervention trials, pilot trials, and meta-analyses. Dr. Barger has experience in factorial designs, dose-response designs, diet-induced disease, and knockout models for pre-clinical studies. As a study statistician, Dr. Barger oversees each study's statistical aspects and prioritizes the application of approaches that promote rigorous statistical practice to enhance scientific reproducibility and research integrity.</p>
      <p>Dr. Barger received her PhD in Statistics from Cornell University, and after working as a statistician in the pharmaceutical industry went back to school to study culinary arts.  She received a Certificate in Patisserie and Baking from Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts and worked production in bakeries for several years.  She returned to statistics with her position at Tufts University.  She is interested in mentoring regarding career paths and professional development.</p>

      Lise-Marie Imbert-Gerard is Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arizona, and I joined in the summer of 2020. She is an applied and computational mathematician, working in the field of partial differential equations on problems related to wave propagation in inhomogeneous media. These inhomogeneous media might be a plasma flow for applications in nuclear fusion, or an air flow for applications in aero-acoustics.
  When she is not working, she enjoys traveling, (mountain) biking, playing classical guitar, reading or learning languages.
