      Lise-Marie Imbert-Gerard is Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arizona, and I joined in the summer of 2020. She is an applied and computational mathematician, working in the field of partial differential equations on problems related to wave propagation in inhomogeneous media. These inhomogeneous media might be a plasma flow for applications in nuclear fusion, or an air flow for applications in aero-acoustics.
  When she is not working, she enjoys traveling, (mountain) biking, playing classical guitar, reading or learning languages.
