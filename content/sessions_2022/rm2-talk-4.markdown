<p>Dr. Fisher received her M.S. in statistics and her Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of Arizona.  Subsequently, she spent a couple years working as a staff statistician in the Statistics Consulting Laboratory before transitioning to her current position as an assistant research professor in the BIO5 Institute.  Her dissertation work focused on understanding the neural processing of speech sounds.  Her current work combines her backgrounds in both neuroimaging and statistics and centers on a) understanding the parameters of existing statistical methods for imaging data and b) developing new methods.  She lives in Tucson with her husband, daughter, and three ridiculous cats.  She loves beautifully-illustrated science literature for children, handstands, and gardening.</p>
