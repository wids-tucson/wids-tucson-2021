      Hong Cui's research focuses on machine learning applications for semantic annotation of semi-structured information, with a current focus on biodiversity literature. She develops and evaluates machine learning and natural language processing
      algorithms for converting born-digital and digitized taxonomic descriptions into new Semantic Web formats. More recently her research has led to ontology building in biology domain. Her work has an explicit impact on how scientific information
      can be retrieved and used in the digital era by turning the wealth of human-readable scientific information into something that can be understood and read by computers. She is the principal investigator or co-PI of a number of National Science
      Foundation-funded projects. The methodology developed by Dr. Cui has been adopted by several other research groups in the US and abroad. She leads the biosemantics research group in the iSchool.

      I study the messy way people talk when they're talking fast in casual conversation, where they leave out a lot of the sounds and even whole words. For example, in one of my group's recordings, a speaker pronounced "gonna hafta" with just two syllables (sort of " got.tuh"), and in another, a different speaker pronounced "do you have time" as two syllables with no trace of the word "have" at all. Another speaker pronounced "Friday night" as one syllable, something like "freh..." stretched out in time. And yet these fast, "sloppy" pronunciations sound fine if you hear them in context, and are not hard to understand if you're hearing your native language. What's amazing is that this is actually how we communicate information. <br><br>
      I also work with the Mutsun community of California, a Native American community from near San Juan Bautista CA, to try to help them learn their heritage language (Mutsun) and teach it in their community. The last person who learned Mutsun fluently as a child passed away in 1930, but there are a lot of written records of the language
