    <TD COLSPAN="3">Karina Salazar is an assistant professor in the Center for the Study of Higher Education at The University of Arizona. Her research program uses data science methodologies to collect data on the enrollment management practices of
      public universities and explores whether these practices undermine access for underserved student populations. Salazar is also co-principal investigator of the Enrollment Management, Recruiting, and Access research project, which investigates
      the recruiting and marketing practices of colleges and universities. This work has been featured by The New York Times, NPR, CNN, Inside Higher Ed, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Forbes, and U.S. News & World Report. Salazar is a local
      Tucsonan and proud graduate of Sunnyside High School. She completed her graduate work at the University of Arizona where her research was funded by the American Educational Research Association.</TD>
