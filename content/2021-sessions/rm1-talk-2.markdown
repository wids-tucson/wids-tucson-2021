Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the 2 most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. In recent years, a non-invasive brain stimulation approach, called “transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS”, has been closely investigated to evaluate its potential to improve clinical symptoms of AD and PD. Accumulating studies investigating the effectiveness of TMS have yielded mixed results, possibly due to low statistical power and wide variation in treatment protocols. In this talk, I will show how we can integrate these findings with meta-analytic approach to account for methodological heterogeneity and more accurately estimate the therapeutic effects of TMS in AD and PD.

Dr. Ying-hui Chou is the director of the Brain Imaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Laboratory at the University of Arizona. Her research has focused primarily on the cognitive and clinical neuroscience of aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Within this framework, Dr. Chou's laboratory is particularly interested in integrating brain imaging and TMS techniques to 1) develop image-guided therapeutic TMS protocols and 2) explore TMS-derived and image-based biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of therapeutic outcomes for individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Dr. Chou teaches undergraduate and graduate level courses in cognitive neuroscience, brain rehabilitation, and brain connectivity at the University of Arizona.
