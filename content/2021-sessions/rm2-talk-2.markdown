  Climate is rapidly changing causing impacts on many parts of the biosphere. Pollinators such as butterflies provide the world with the next generation of flowring plants. Climate  warming is a threat to pollinator health threatening many species. Here I show how human-computer collaborations at scale can provide a snapshot of butterfly health across continents. This data is then combined  with other data sources from previous research and community science efforts to understand how climate change impacts butterfly species across the western US. We will discuss the joys of user experience, data wrangling, visualization, cleaning,  analyses, and sharing all while on the hunt to help butterflies in a changing world.

  I study where pollinators are, what they are doing, and how we can help them in a rapidly changing world using citizen and data science techniques. My research has been published in Science, Proceedings of the National Academy, and Nature Communications Biology and featured in New York Times, Washington Post, and National Geographic. I teach in the General Education and Wildlife curricula. I use active learning to show how collaboration, data science, and computer programming is a necessary tool for saving organisms from extinction.
