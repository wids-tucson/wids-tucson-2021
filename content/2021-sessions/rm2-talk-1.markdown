The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed epidemic modeling at the forefront of public policymaking. Predicting the severity and speed of transmission of COVID-19 is crucial to resource management and developing strategies to deal with this epidemic. Despite the usefulness, modeling and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 remains a challenge. In this talk, we selectively review models for epidemic forecasting, especially in COVID-19 projection, and illustrate how these models could be connected to each other. We lay out the challenges of COVID-19 forecasting from data collection, curation, and validation to the limitations of models as well as the uncertainty of the forecast. Finally, we discuss some data science practices that are crucial to more robust and accurate epidemic forecasting.
